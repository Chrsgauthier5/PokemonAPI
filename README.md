# PokemonAPI
API for Pokemon Gifs

The purpose of this project is to display the usage of calling an API using AJAX.
The API we are calling for this is the giphy API.  Users can choose from the preselected pokemon that are provided in the boxes to start to see GIFs of that pokemon. 
Users can also manually input a pokemon of there choices - this will add a box for the pokemon so they can then click the box and see gifs for that Pokemon!
